        <p>Nothing says down-home comfort quite like shrimp and grits. Bold, peppery gravy, succulent seafood, 
            and rich sausage create a bite that's too perfect not to make. Learn how to create a restaurant-quality brunch dish 
            in a few simple steps and have a deliciously hearty Lowcountry meal in no time. </p>
        <p><h1>The Best Grits for Shrimp and Grits </h1></p>
        <p>When it comes to selecting your grits, quality is key. While the 5-minute variety offers convenience, 
            stone-ground grits provide an authentic texture that can't be substituted. One part grits to 4 parts liquid is the fuss-free 
            ratio that gets deliciously creamy results every time.</p>

        <p>Add water, salt, and milk to a standard-sized pot (use half-and-half for an even richer result) and 
            allow the mixture to come to a simmer before whisking in the grits. Gently stir, allowing the grits to 
            come back to a gentle bubbling, then lower the heat and cover until fully cooked. </p>
